## Welcome to VisualEYES

VisualEYES is a VIVID projection paired with an App to let users contribute to a piece of realtime art generated from users responses to questions within the app. In fact we aim to raise public awareness of the NSW government datasets used by proposing it to The Guiness World Record for "Most contributions to an interactive rating-system display"

Through social media and the vivid app - we will invite users to take part in this - gaining traction to our app and display that involves the use of the many datasets.
